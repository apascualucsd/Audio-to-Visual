# Audio-to-Visual

Developed a system that converts FFT data from a microphone into dynamic visualizations. Implemented advanced signal filtering and amplification and used a neural network to predict color representations based on audio context. Created a responsive visual representation of audio data.

## My Role:

Engineered an advanced algorithm to transform audio data captured from a microphone into precise frequency and amplitude components, which are then seamlessly converted into RGB tuples for sophisticated data visualization and analysis.
